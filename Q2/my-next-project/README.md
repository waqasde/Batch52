This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Your task is to research Next.js 14 and list down all its new features and improvements. Provide a brief explanation for each feature listed, focusing on how it contributes to enhancing the development experience or application performance.

Next.js 14 introduces several new features and improvements that enhance both the development experience and application performance:


Turbopack: This is the successor to Webpack, designed to provide incredibly fast compilations and updates. It’s a Rust-based engine that has passed thousands of integration tests, ensuring compatibility and performance1.


Server Actions (Stable): These allow for progressively enhanced mutations, integrating with caching and revalidating, and can be used with simple function calls or natively with forms. This simplifies the developer experience of authoring data mutations1.


Partial Prerendering (Preview): This feature enables a fast initial static response combined with streaming dynamic content. It allows developers to optimize the loading performance of their applications by serving static content quickly while dynamic content loads in the background1.


Next.js Learn (New): A free course teaching the App Router, authentication, databases, and more. This educational resource is aimed at helping developers get up to speed with the latest Next.js features1.


Next.js Compiler Improvements: The compiler has been turbocharged for better local development performance, especially in the Pages and App Router. This results in faster server startup and code updates with Fast Refresh1.


Enhanced Routing: Simplified file-based routing with support for dynamic routes. This improvement makes it easier for developers to set up and manage routes in their applications2.

These features collectively contribute to a more efficient and enjoyable development process, as well as faster, more responsive applications for end-users.
